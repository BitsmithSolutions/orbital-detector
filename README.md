# orbital detector

Code for finding, analyzing and visualizing police aircraft over Los Angeles.

## Creating the database

This code assumes you have postgres and postgis installed.


### Prep the database

```
$ createdb orbital
$ cat orbital.sql | psql orbital
```


### Load a basestation.sqb

Put a basestation.sqb, from whatever source, in the current directory,
then run the following:

```
$ pgloader basestation.load
```


### Ingest PlanePlotter logs

You can load PlanePlotter "receiver logs" AKA "Mode-S logs" AKA "RTL
logs" into the database. You can load gzipped or uncompressed logs
(log files typically get ~98% compression).

```
$ lein run -m com.lemondronor.orbital-detector.reports \
  postgresql://localhost:5432/orbital logs/RTL*.gz
```

Reports are put into the `reports` table, which has the following schema:

| Column       | Description                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| timestamp    | timestamp with time zone    |
| icao         | ICAO hex code (string)      |
| registration | Callsign/registration       |
| altitude     | Altitude                    |
| lat          | Latitude                    |
| lon          | Longitude                   |
| position     | PostGIS geometry of lat/lon |
| speed        | Speed                       |
| heading      | Heading                     |
| squawk       | [Squawk code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_%28aeronautics%29#Code_assignments) |


By default, at most one ping per aircraft per second is saved. You can
use `--time-window-secs` to do something different:
`--time-window-secs 0` will keep every ping, `--time-window-secs 10`
will keep only one ping per aircraft per 10 seconds.

By default, all pings are saved, including positionless (mode A/C)
pings. If you only want to save pings that have positions, use
`--with-position-only`.


## Visualizations

### log2kml

![KML screenshot](/screenshots/log2kml.jpg?raw=true "KML screenshot")

You can create KML tracks of aircraft with log2kml.

```
$ lein run -m com.lemondronor.orbital-detector.log2kml \
  --icaos AE094B,A68A37 \
  --extended-data aircraft.csv \
  RTL15030200.log.gz RTL15030300.log.gz > log.kml
```

It can handle gzipped or uncompressed logs.

You can use the `--icaos` flag to specify a comma-delimited list of
the ICAO codes of the aircraft you're interested in.

The `--extended-data` flag can be used to provide extra information
about aircraft. It should be the path to a CSV-exported version of a
file that has the same structure as
[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lAJzkdHX554RbqzRU3hIIl6Aen9b57d_oXbOQnQTzRY/edit?usp=sharing).


### Tippecanoe

You can use [tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe) to
create highly detailed, zoomable maps.
